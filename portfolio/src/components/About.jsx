          <p>
            Welcome to my website, My name is Lynda Santiago. I am a Web
            Developer &Â UI Designer who enjoys creating beautiful user friendly
            interfaces. I designed this website using Adobe XD and then coded it
            using React.js & Sass. I am constantly experimenting in new
            technologies and always striving to be a better web developer &
            designer. When I'm not coding or pushing pixels you'll find me meal
            prepping, exercising, watching scary movies, laughing, being goofy &
            spending time with my family.
